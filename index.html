	<h1>A Simple Guide To Create a decentralized Application on the Blockchain (DApp) </h1>
	<p id="summary">Create, compile, deploy and test a smart contracts on Ethereum + Angular/react</p>

	<!-- intro below -->
	<div class="view absolute" id='intro-view'>
		<div class="center-column">
			<p class="explain">
				In this Tutorial, we learn how to create a simple decentlized application
				by writing a simple smart contract and the proper UI for it, then we use web3 to allow our client-side application to talk to the blockchain,
				at the end we take a look at two most used frontend frameworks "Angular and react" and see which
				could be the best possible option while creating a DApp.
			</p>
			<p>
				before we start we need to know what is a blockchain and why and most importantly when should it be used, therefore we
				look at the pro and cons of using the blockchain to realize blockchain is not always the solution and we need to be sure
				about the reason that we approache it.

				<h3> Create the smart contract </h3>
				<p> In this section we will be covering how to make a smart contract?</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Step 1: Write the smart contract in solidity</li>
					<p>Solidity like any other language has it’s own syntax and there is
						<a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.25/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html">
							a documentation page </a>, which
						will be update once a new version of library is released.
						</br>
						<code> pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
							</br>
							contract SimpleStorage {
							} </code>
						</br>
						We usually try to keep the contract short, so we don’t have to redeploy our contract every time
						something changes, because redeploying means changing the address and in some cases
						address of smart contract needs to be stable. Other than that, everything that we
						write in smart contract will be staying on the blockchain forever, so we try to keep
						the private information out of smart contract.
					</p>


					<li> Step 2: Test the smart contract in Remix </li>
					<p>Easiest and the fastest way to test if our contract is functioning
						and the syntax of our code is correct, is by testing it in remix
						, remix is “a web browser based IDE that allows you to write
						Solidity smart contracts, then deploy and run the smart contract
						.” [Remix - The Ethereum Wiki] usually when a contract runs on
						the remix, it means that we can deploy it and know that everything
						is alright.
						Remix has 3 type of environments: Javascript VM, Injected provider,
						or Web3 provider.
						Both Web3 provider (Ethereum node) and Injected provider (Mist or Metamask)
						require the use of an external tool.
						The JavaScript VM mode is convenient because each execution runs in your browser.
						Thus reloading the page will restart Remix with an empty state.
					</p>
					<li> Step 3: Create truffle base project and run either testRPC or ganache</li>
					<p>In order to make sure that our smart contract does exactly as it is sopposed to and checking if
						the right event is emited, we write a test based application to test our smart contract
						and we use truffle init project for it.
						<ul>
							<li> Import smart contract in folder contract</li>
							With truffle init, we get an empty deployable project from truffle and then we have to add
							our own smart contract in truffle contract folder
							.
							<li> Change the truffle.js and write another file for deploy your current contract.</li>
							Then we need a migration file for the new contract and in config file we have to establish
							our information.
							<li> Create tests either in JavaScript or in solidity and import them in folder test</li>
							<li> Run truffle compile and test</li>/<ul>
								Once everything is ready we check for truffle migrate and compile and if did deploy and
								compiled without any problem , then we can start writing our test. Ther are possibility for writing the tests, one is with javascript or
								with solodoty it self.
								Tests have to be usefull and they have to test our main functionallyit and also if the events
								are emmited when they should and not emited
								when they should not.

								since we needs accounts to test our smart contract , one for sender and one or many other
								for receiver we lunch either testrpc or ganache
								, we just have to be sure that the local port ist the same as our config file in truffle.
								Before: install Npm / truffle/testRPC or ganache
					</p>
					<ul> Before: install Npm / truffle/testRPC or ganache</ul>




					<li> OPTIONAL: create the frontend and use GitHub pages to upload the code and the contract</li>

			<div id="Deploy" class="tabcontent">
				<h3>Deploy</h3>
				<p>how to deploy it on the test-net:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Install meta mask</li>
					<li>Ropsten is our test environment</li>
					<li>Ask for test ether: https://faucet.ropsten.be/, https://faucet.metamask.io/</li>
					<li>Set up infura account</li>
					<li>Document the API from remix</li>
					<li>Deploy on the ethereum.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>

			<div id="Web3.js" class="tabcontent">
				<h3>Web3.js</h3>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li> Step 1: After deploying the contract, you have a file with api and address of the contract</li>
						<li>Step 2: Now we can create a static page that runs on the local host.</li>
						<li>Step 3: We will be writing a JavaScript file and listen to event, we make a transaction.</li>
						<li>Step 4: In order to list the events, we will be using socket.io</li>
						<li>Step 5: Possible frameworks for this tutorial react, Angular JS and …</li>
						<li>Finally : At the end we have a contract on blockchain and we can make transaction and we can see a list of our transaction on our website on local host.</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>React/Angualr</h3>
				<p>in this section we will be comparing two most used front-end frameworks </p>
				<h3>Why use front-end frameworks? </h3>

				<ul>
					<li> develop faster </li>
					<li></li>

				<p>A comparision of angular and React !</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Angular </li>

				</ol>
				<ol>
					<li>React </li>
					<p>React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook, it is a User Interface (UI) library and a tool for building UI components</p>

				<h3> GitHub pages setup !</h3>
				<p>In this section, we will be publishing the static website on github so everybody can access it.
					These steps will guide you through pushing your project into a repository and publishing it.
					<ol>
						<li>first of all, you need to signup in github and have an account then if you don’t already have a repository on github,
						you need to create a Repository and pushing the code to the repository.</li>
						<li> create a new repo: go to github.com/new </li>
						<li> Repository Name could be the name of the project.</li>
						<li> Click Create Repository</li>
						<li> by going to the setting you can see the link to the git hub page, which is basically username + github+ io +repository name.</li>
