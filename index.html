				You’ll see from the code above that we assigned both functions the modifier public . Since Solidity knows two kinds of function calls (internal ones that do not create an actual EVM call — also called a “message call” — and external ones that do), there are four types of visibilities for functions and state variables. Functions can be specified as being external, public, internal or private, the default is public . Aside from the fact that Remix will throw a warning message stating that no visibility is specified and it’s defaulting to public , typing out the function visibility is a good habit to get into. It will allow us to better understand the contract settings when evaluating our code.

	We’re getting close, but not quite there. Our state variable can change depending on the function we call, but we need a function that will output the value of counter . Try creating a function called “getCounter()” that will return counter. This will be a read only action, so we need to tell our function that we’ll be returning a constant. Additionally, when returning a state variable we must tell our function the type that is being returned, in this case we’re returning an uint256 as discussed earlier.You’ll see from the code above that we assigned both functions the modifier public .
