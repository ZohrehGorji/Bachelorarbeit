				<h3> Create the smart contract </h3>
				<p> In this section we will be covering how to make a smart contract?</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Step 1: Write the smart contract in solidity</li>
					<p>Solidity like any other language has it’s own syntax and there is a documentation page 
						https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.25/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html which 
						will be update once a new version of library is released.
					<code> pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
					contract SimpleStorage {
					} </code>
					We usually try to keep the contract short, so we don’t have to redeploy our contract every time 
						something changes, because redeploying means changing the address and in some cases 
						address of smart contract needs to be stable.  Other than that, everything that we 
						write in smart contract will be staying on the blockchain forever, so we try to keep
						the private information out of smart contract.
					</p>
					
					
					<li> Step 2: Test the smart contract in Remix </li>
					<p>Easiest and the fastest way to test if our contract is functioning 
						and the syntax of our code is correct, is by testing it in remix
						, remix is “a web browser based IDE that allows you to write
						Solidity smart contracts, then deploy and run the smart contract
						.” [Remix - The Ethereum Wiki] usually when a contract runs on 
						the remix, it means that we can deploy it and know that everything
						is alright.
						Remix has 3 type of environments: Javascript VM, Injected provider,
						or Web3 provider.
						Both Web3 provider (Ethereum node) and Injected provider (Mist or Metamask)
						require the use of an external tool.
						The JavaScript VM mode is convenient because each execution runs in your browser. 
						Thus reloading the page will restart Remix with an empty state.
						</p>
					<li>  Step 3: Create truffle base project and run either testRPC or ganache</li>
					<p>In order to make sure that our smart contract does exactly as it is sopposed to and checking if
						the right event is emited, we write a test based application to test our smart contract
						and we use truffle init project for it.
						<ul><li> Import smart contract in folder contract</li>
						With truffle init, we get an empty deployable project from truffle and then we have to add 
						our own smart contract in truffle contract folder
						. 
							<li> Change the truffle.js and write another file for deploy your current contract.</li>
							Then we need a migration file for the new contract and in config file we have to establish 
						our information.
							<li> Create tests either in JavaScript or in solidity and import them in folder test</li>
							<li> Run truffle compile and test</li>/<ul>
						Once everything is ready we check for truffle migrate and compile and if did deploy and 
						compiled without any problem , then we can start writing our test. Ther are possibility for writing the tests, one is with javascript or 
						with solodoty it self.
						Tests have to be usefull and they have to test our main functionallyit and also if the events
						are emmited when they should and not emited
						when they should not.

							since we needs accounts to test our smart contract , one for sender and one or many other
						for receiver we lunch either testrpc or ganache
						, we just have to be sure that the local port ist the same as our config file in truffle.
						Before: install Npm / truffle/testRPC or ganache
					</p>
					<ul> Before: install Npm / truffle/testRPC or ganache</ul>
					
					
					
					
					<li> OPTIONAL: create the frontend and use GitHub pages to upload the code and the contract</li>

				<h3>Deploy</h3>
				<p>how to deploy it on the test-net:</p>
				<ol>	
				<li>Install meta mask</li>
				<li>Ropsten is our test environment</li>
				<li>Ask for test ether: https://faucet.ropsten.be/, https://faucet.metamask.io/</li>
				<li>Set up infura account</li>
				<li>Document the API from remix</li>
				<li>Deploy on the ethereum.</li>
